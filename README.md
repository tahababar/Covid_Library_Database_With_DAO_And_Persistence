# Covid_Library_Database_With_DAO_And_Persistence
This is a database that uses the DAO model with JDBC to create a program that perfroms multiple queries. The database is designed to help libraries check out books safely to students. Students can pick up books from designated locations and this makes the checkout process covid-friendly and safe. The schema includes four tables: checkout, book, student and department. Each table has a primary key and some tables include reference keys as well. Examples of some queries include listing all the books in the library, selecting a book to checkout, displaying checkout list, and deleting a checkout entry etc. Javax.persistence is used to provide the database with an object oriented approach.
